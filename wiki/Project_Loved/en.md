# Project Loved

**Project Loved** is the voting platform that promotes beatmaps to the [Loved](/wiki/Beatmaps#loved) category. It is run primarily by the [Project Loved Team](/wiki/People/Project_Loved_Team).

## Moving a beatmap to Loved

Beatmaps are moved to Loved by a nomination and voting process.

Members of the Project Loved Team called **captains** regularly nominate beatmapsets for a specific game mode. Almost always, these sets come from submissions from the osu! community. The current Loved submission forms and listings can be found via the following links:

*Note: If your access to Google Forms is restricted, you may also contact any of the [Project Loved Team members](/wiki/People/Project_Loved_Team#team-members) to have a map submitted on your behalf.*

Nominated mapsets are then posted to the [Project Loved forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120), where community members may vote whether they want the mapset to be Loved or not. Maps reaching a specified threshold percentage of "Yes" votes at their polls' end time will be moved to the Loved category.

### Eligibility

There are some very minimal criteria that need to be met for beatmaps to be approved for Loved. Captains consider a beatmapset eligible for the Loved category if:

- It is not in the [Qualified](/wiki/Beatmaps#qualified), [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmaps#ranked) or [Approved](/wiki/Beatmaps#approved) categories
- Its creator does not disapprove of it being Loved
- Its creator is not banned or restricted
- At least one difficulty can be passed
- No difficulties contain beatmapping errors (timing issues, incorrect file formatting, etc.)

However, despite nearly all [Pending and Work-in-progress](/wiki/Beatmaps#pending) maps meeting these criteria, few are voted into the Loved category due to the more selective nomination and voting requirements.

### Nomination Priority

There are no strict rules governing which maps a captain must nominate for Loved, but generally the nominated maps are very well known and appreciated by the community (as the title "Loved" implies). Sometimes a mapset will also be preferred if it is significantly older than others or contains beatmaps with unique and high-quality mapping styles.

## Further Information

All of the organisation and planning for Project Loved is done in the `#osu-loved` channel of the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy). Any questions, concerns, or suggestions may be directed there.
